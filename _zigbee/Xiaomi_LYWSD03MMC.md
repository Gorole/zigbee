## How To

This Bluetooth sensor can be converted to a Zigbee one with just a webpage and a device with Bluetooth. Open the [web flasher](https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/TelinkMiFlasher.html) and follow the procedure in video.

## Troubleshooting

- make sure the Xiaomi sensor is close to the Bluetooth radio
- use a full battery, if its lower than 40% flashing could fail and brick the device
- if the sensor disconnects mid flash (for me it was around 50%) try installing the BLE 4.5 firmware first then do the Zigbee conversion

## Serial Flash

If the OTA fails or you want to revert back to Bluetooth firmware you need to flash it using a serial to USB adapter. Wire the device like this:

Visit [USBCOM Flasher](https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/USBCOMFlashTx.html), "Connect" to the port of the serial adapter, "Choose File" ([`z03mmc.bin`](https://github.com/devbis/z03mmc/releases) for Zigbee or download one of the [Bluetooth](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/tree/master) firmwares)

"Write to Flash" and wait for the process to complete. If you have issues run "Erase All Flash" first.
